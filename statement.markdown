My formal training includes degrees in Biostatistics (Sc.M. Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, 2021) and Applied Mathematics (B.A. Honors New College of Florida, 2016).
These pursuits were intentional enrichment of my theoretical toolset to complement my curiosity for the natural (and digital) world. 
Practically, these theoretical tools have been applied in mathematical modeling, statistical inference, genomics/genetics, machine learning, operations research, and GIS/spatial statistics.

In particular, you will find that my capacity in particular to integrate practical experience and theoretical knowledge in tackling new problems.
In particular, my ability to understand and more importantly convey the meaning of the data. The ability to convey meaning is demonstrated through my publication record. I have experience in(non)relational databases, genomic/genetic data types, images and video processing (detection/classification).
I believe these capacities are illustrated in my ability to translate findings in visually and thematically cohesive figures and animations. To this end,  I have embedded two figures from recent theoretical 

Typically with integration of multiple .. with agnostic integration of whichever languages suite the given task
(languages go here).
and  facilitates me to process and overcome new theoretical and practical challenges.
I have presented two figures from recent work in my Masters S.CM, to demonstrate how i convey a information through plots.
I hope you will find my qualifications make me a strong candidate for this position.  


Am looking for new challenges in exciting applications for mathematical programming.

You will find that my breadth of applied knowledge, adaptability, as well as rigorous theoretical and practical backgrounds make me a compelling candidate to propel your organization past any data-driven problem.

Outside of the digital world, one can find me working toward a self-sufficient homestead in Punta Gorda, FL.
