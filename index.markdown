Does your organization require efficient technical solutions, theoretical insight, or assistance with development of impactful narratives?
My aptitude is to provide [intelligible, explicit, and domain-aware solutions](/skills.markdown) for a [wide breadth of disciplines](/experience.markdown).
I can reduce stress and provide clarity around a host of contemporary data-related issues, particularly the extraction of an understandable and meaningful story from your data.
I provide consulting and contracting; feel free to **<span title="ntdyjack 'at' gmail 'dot' com">contact me (mouseover)</span>**.
My [personal statement](/statement.markdown) contains example deliverables, a brief clip of me delivering a presentation, and a bit more details on my passions and qualifications.
[Publicly-licensed](https://github.com/ntdyjack/) and [peer-reviewed](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KXKrFoAAAAAJ) samples of my work can also be accessed from the site footer.
Outside of the digital world, one may find me working toward a self-sufficient homestead in Southwest Florida.
