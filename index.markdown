My aptitude is to provide [intelligible, explicit, and domain-aware solutions](skills.markdown) for a [wide breadth of disciplines](experience.markdown) -- I genuinely enjoy immersing myself in new fields.
I am open to consulting  and contracting (short-term) positions; feel free to **<span title="ntdyjack 'at' gmail 'dot' com">contact me (mouseover)</span>**.
My [personal statement](statement.markdown) contains example deliverables, a brief clip of me giving a talk, and a bit more details on my passions and qualifications.
[Publicly-licensed](https://github.com/ntdyjack/) and [peer-reviewed](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KXKrFoAAAAAJ) samples of my work can also be accessed from the site footer.
Outside of the digital world, one may find me working toward a self-sufficient homestead in Southwest Florida.
